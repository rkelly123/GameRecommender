# Crowdsourced video game recommendation system (CVRS)

This is a system that recommends videogames to users
based on the experiences of other users. A database is used
to store a variety of user and video game data. A user can flag
certain games as their "favorites", and based on this and a few 
other factors, the program increases the similarity between games.
This similarity is increased for all users when any user assigns
some new favorite games. Then, the program recommends the games
with the highest similarity to the other games that you have marked 
as a favorite. 

## Usage

Although the program is fully functional with an attached database,
the database that I used is a private one associated with my University.
As such, I have had to remove the database credentials from the code, and
the code will therefore not run. If you wish to run the code, you may add
your oracle username and password to the App class in the very obvious
location. You will also need to set up the database by running the setup.sql
script before trying to use it. If you are just interested in how the application
runs, feel free to look at the attached images!

## Backstory

This program was originally created as a project for a university database course.
I struck an interest in the content, and decided to go even further into the material
so that I may create something interesting. I had never utilized a database before, let
alone set one up, so it was a valuable learning experience. All in all, I had a lot of fun
with this project, and learned a lot from it.

## Developed Skills

Throughout the creation of this project, I
1. developed a foundational knowledge base in oracle/jdbc databases
2. further practiced by SQL and Java programming skills
3. practiced git version and collaboration control
4. learned more about swing and GUI creation
